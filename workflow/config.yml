  subpops: "accessory/1000G_PopLabels.txt" #MODIFY: File that labels each individual in the reference dataset with the population they are from.  Used as input into pop_map function in Snakefile
  genmap: "PATH_TO_DATA_SUBDIRECTORY/genetic_map_hg19.txt" #MODIFY: tab-separated file with 3 column per line: chromosome, physical base position, genetic map position.
  subset_bcf: 'none' #Not required. If the 'vcf' file had already been subset for the pops listed below (e.g. in a prior run), this can be provided here to avoid needing to repeat the step.
singularity:
  use_singularity: 'true' #Use a singularity image (i.e. set to true) if possible.  Pipeline has only been tested/debugged with singularity.
  image: 'DIRECTORY_CONTAINING/AncestryInference.sif' # MODIFY: Path to singularity image file.  The one I used for everything is named AncestryInference.sif, which can be created from scratch using .def file in AncInf repo.
  code: 'scripts/' #Path to the scripts directory that was cloned with repo.  Should not need to change this value.
  module: 'module load singularity' #Command that the HPC requires for use of singularity.  Set to empty string if singularity is loaded by default.
samples: "all"  # This can be set to path of file containing individuals to be kept from merged query file. Must be in an acceptable format for subsetting plink files (One sample per line, two columns: fid iid)

  threads: "12" # Number of processors to use for parallel computation.  12 is good for array-sized datasets, but I've increased up to 48 for WGS or imputed data.
  generations: "8" #Generations since admixture began.  7 or 8 is often used for African-American admixture and 12 for Latinx admixture.  Appropriate value for when query data contains a mix of ancestries is an open question. Best approach would be to analyze separately.
  reanalyze_reference: "true" #In the case a set of reference haplotypes may not be of "pure" ancestry and may themselves be somewhat admixed, the option --reanalyze-reference will cause the program to analyze the reference haplotypes as if they were query haplotypes, in addition to analyzing the query input.
  window_size: "0.2"  # Specified in cM.  Default is 0.2 cM, which corresponds to ~100 - 150 kb windows.  If fewer than 10 SNPs are present in the window, then window is expanded.  For arrays, ~0.2 is likely the max resolution, but WGS data could handle 0.02
